<em>This post contains the activities for Day 3 of the strategy retreat. For more information and the links to the activities from other days, please see the [strategy retreat post](http://techtohuman.com/strategy_retreat/).</em> 

## Day 3

Before you start - Opening Circle. <a href="http://techtohuman.com/strategy_day_1">See day 1</a>. 

1. [Headlines & How tos](http://techtohuman.com/headlines_how_tos). This activity will likely take most of a morning. I suggest starting when people's brains are fresh and trying to complete as soon as possible. This is likely to generate a lot of debate and I suggest separating the debate with a break and then giving people the chance to discuss in a laid-back setting. <a name="output12"> <br>
At the end of this activity, you will be left with <strong>output 12:</strong> a first draft of the suggested headlines for your strategy, rationales for each and with suggested aligned activities.

<ol start="2">
 <li>Observations & Documentation - A non-structured session for documenting the outputs of the above session. I suggest providing biscuits and lemonade and allowing people to work at their leisure around a table as things will probably occur to them from the previous session which will require clarity when documenting. . </li>

DELIBERATELY LONG LUNCHBREAK FOLLOWED BY FREE AFTERNOON

# The "Free" afternoon - AKA Retrospective time!

Well... the free afternoon was what we planned (genuinely!). Actually, we ended up doing a retrospective in the afternoon because the team actually begged. Workaholics. 

I won't reinvent the wheel on how to do retrospectives. Here's a list of my favourite resources to consult: 

* [Trello sprint retrospective](https://trello.com/b/YEXXigXH/template-sprint-retrospective) - for retrospectives of small projects, this asks all the right questions. For longer ones or more complex projects, you might need something a bit more heavyweight. 
* [The Anatomy of a Retrospective](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/Anatomy.html) - more detailed tips (see in particular the timeline section) on how to run retrospectives for more complicated projects.

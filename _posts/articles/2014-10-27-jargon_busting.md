# Jargon busting - an activity for training techie trainers  

As a trainer who knows a little bit about technology - it's easy to get carried away in the moment; satisfied that we have finally understood what an API is, or why people should care about JSON - we forget that we didn't always know, and that the bewildered people in the room probably don't know either. 

At School of Data, we pride ourselves on plain-language training. We also train a lot of trainers, so we try and impress on them early on how important it is to be jargon free. This is one of my favourite exercises for making sure people remember not to get too carried away with jargon in their training.  

## Ten hundred words 

<p> <strong> Audience for activity: </strong> Trainers </p>
<p> <strong> Purpose: </strong>  Discourage your trainers from using jargon </p>

The nerds among you will likely be familiar with the brilliant online comic [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) - which shines light into some of the geekiest topics on the planet. <em>(Aside: you know you have truly achieved nerd status when you understand all of the jokes there.) </em> Some of you will also be familiar with the "Up-Goer-Five comic" where Randall (the author) attempts to label a rocket, in all of its complexity, using only the top "ten hundred" aka "one thousand"  <em>(Sign of the times: apparently, "thousand" didn't make it into the top 1000 words, but "computer" did!)</em> words. The result is very amusing:

## How it works: 

It can be very funny to try and explain some of the most complex topics in tech using the same method - and you can use the ["up-goer five text editor"](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) to help you. The text editor only allows you to enter words that appear in the 1000 most popular words in the English language.

Set your trainers the challenge to brainstorm a list of the concepts that people find most problematic during training, and then have a competition for who can come up with the best definition in the constraints available. Revel in the comedy of watching the frustration. Need some words to get you started? Try: API, data, XML, pull request, sandbox. 

I first tried this exercise at [Transparency Camp in 2013](http://transparencycamp.org/), the [etherpad](http://transparencycamp.org/schedule/2013/translating-tech/) is flaky but it is still alive. To test our success (which we defined by people being able to reverse engineer the term we were trying to describe from our description): we tweeted out our definitions on the conference and [#translatetech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/translatetech) hashtags X to see if people could reverse engineer them and tweet back what we were trying to define... 

Now obviously - this is extreme. The slightly cryptic definitions which arise from it might not be the best ones for your trainers to use to explain actual concepts. However, the point of the exercise is to harness that frustration from being forced to use very basic words to cement a recurring memory into the trainers - so that they never forget to keep it simple!

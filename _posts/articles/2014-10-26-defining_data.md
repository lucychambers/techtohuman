# Defining Data 

## The Activity

At a lot of the events I attend, there is a tendency to talk about data - as if it were a homogenous, unchanging thing, like something you could pick up at a supermarket. 

It's pretty dangerous territory to be in - particularly for the civic tech and open data movements as the wave of paranoia resulting from recent privacy scares start to take over. If these movements are not careful to define the realms in which it is appropriate to open data and where not, a knee-jerk reaction threatens to shut down data release or data collection before we have seen the true potential that opening up data could hold.

As a reaction to this, I had been asked to run an exercise to come up with a "typology of data" a couple of times - first at the [Ethics of Data in Civil Society](http://pacscenter.stanford.edu/content/ethics-data-conference) in Stanford, where I got my dress rehearsal, and secondly recently at a kick off event for the Civicus [DataShift](http://civicus.org/thedatashift/). The context was slightly different each time, but I think I have finally found a way to frame the activity such that it makes it accessible to a broad spectrum of people -while still capturing numerous different ways that we could categorise data to build a typology. Ultimately - any dataset will ultimately fit into multiple categories - depending on what you are interested in.

### Required materials 

* Post-it notes (2 colours)
* Sharpies (or other bold pens)

### Step 1: (Brain)Storm

Ask members of your group to write down any adjective which they have heard of as applying to data. That could be any adjective from 'big' to 'messy'. Give them 4-5 minutes to think about it on their own. One adjective per post-it. 

### Step 2: Splat 

Have everyone put their post-it notes on a wall - let people see the range of answers which people have come up with. 

### Step 3: Snake (Or 'cluster' - but that breaks the alliteration)

Have people work out whether there are any patterns or themes, then group the post-its by theme into a 'snake' (see image above). Give the snake a 'title' - i.e. what does it represent? 

### Step 4: Step Back

As a group - take a look at the first draft of the typology. What do you observe? Is there anything missing? Feel free to respond as appropriate - this may mean adding additional post-its or even columns. 


## Where Next? The Data Stork

I recently pitched this exercise as the first step a way of understanding where data comes from (I called it "the data stork"). This was important, as I was at an event which was using crowdsourcing as a blanket term for citizen-generated data - so having a better understanding of the different types of data helped to unpack how citizens might be able to contribute (or not) to their production and why that might be useful. 

One of the participants also suggested we generate a [Family Fortunes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Fortunes), or [Pointless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_(game_show)) game around the adjectives - an excellent idea to surface which terms people know best and least.

# Non-verbal communication for silent cries of 'help!'' in workshops  

Non-verbal cues can be an excellent way to give workshop participants a way to show that they are not able to follow what you are saying, without breaking the flow of you talking by interrupting to ask a question.

Your audience will determine how silly you can make the gestures, but here are the ones we used at the [Info Activism Camp](https://camp2013.tacticaltech.org/) (*Credits* <-) from which I stole this. I have subsequently used them with a variety of audiences of varying levels of seriousness and it is incredible that in some circumstances you can indeed get even very serious people in suits to do the moose, and they actually appreciate it. 

The gestures are elegantly modelled below by yours truly, and yes, that is my knee in the frame as I had to press the screen with my toe to record using [Loopcam](http://loopc.am/), with a cartoon filter that makes me look like I have a moustache. 

## Gesture 1: Jargon Goggles

## Tips 

Demonstrate these to the people in the room, showing that you have no shame; you'll get even stiff-upper-lipped English people to do them. Refresh them on a regular basis, the beginning of each new day!
